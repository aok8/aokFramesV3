# My First Roll of Film: A Journey into Analog Photography

After years of shooting digital, I finally took the plunge into film photography. Armed with my newly acquired Canon AE-1 and a roll of Kodak Portra 400, I set out to explore this classic medium. Here's what I learned from my first roll of film.

## The Camera: Canon AE-1

The Canon AE-1 is a legendary 35mm SLR camera from the late 1970s. Despite its age, it feels incredibly solid and well-built. The mechanical shutter sound is satisfying in a way that no digital camera can match. Key features I appreciated:

- Aperture-priority automatic exposure
- Clear viewfinder with split-prism focusing
- Simple, intuitive controls
- Reliable light meter

## The Film: Kodak Portra 400

I chose Kodak Portra 400 for my first roll because of its:
- Forgiving exposure latitude
- Beautiful, natural color rendition
- Excellent skin tones
- Versatility in different lighting conditions

## The Learning Experience

### Slowing Down
The biggest difference from digital was the pace of shooting. With only 36 exposures and no instant feedback, I found myself:

1. **Taking more time** to compose each shot
2. **Thinking carefully** about exposure settings
3. **Being more selective** about what I photographed
4. **Focusing on the moment** rather than checking the LCD screen

### Technical Challenges

Film photography presented several new challenges:
- **Manual focusing**: Takes practice but becomes intuitive
- **No instant feedback**: Had to trust the light meter and my instincts
- **Limited exposures**: Each frame feels precious
- **Film loading**: Took a few tries to get it right

## The Results

Getting the developed film back was exciting! Some observations:

### What Worked Well
- Colors are rich and natural
- Highlights have beautiful rolloff
- Grain adds character to the images
- Skin tones are gorgeous

### Room for Improvement
- A few shots were slightly underexposed
- Some focus wasn't as sharp as intended
- Film loading marks on the first few frames
- One double exposure (unintentional)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check the film door**: Always make sure it's properly closed
2. **Meter carefully**: Especially in tricky lighting conditions
3. **Wind gently**: Rough film advance can cause scratches
4. **Keep notes**: Document camera settings for learning

## The Cost Factor

Film photography isn't cheap:
- Film: $15 per roll
- Development: $12
- Scanning: $8
- Total: $35 for 36 exposures

But the experience and results make it worthwhile.

## Moving Forward

This first roll has completely hooked me on film photography. Future plans include:

- Trying different film stocks
- Experimenting with black and white
- Learning to develop my own film
- Building a proper archival system

## Conclusion

While digital remains practical for many situations, film offers a unique shooting experience that encourages mindfulness and creativity. The limitations become advantages, forcing you to slow down and think more carefully about each frame.

I'm excited to continue this journey into analog photography. There's something special about creating physical negatives that can last for generations, each frame a tangible piece of captured time.
