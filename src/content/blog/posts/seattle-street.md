# Seattle Street Photography: A Rainy Day at Pike Place

There's something magical about Seattle on a rainy day. The glistening streets, the umbrellas bobbing through crowds, and the soft, diffused light create the perfect conditions for street photography. Today, I spent several hours wandering through Pike Place Market, capturing candid moments of daily life in one of Seattle's most iconic locations.

## The Market Atmosphere

Pike Place Market has a unique energy that's amplified by the rain. Vendors calling out their catches of the day, the aroma of fresh flowers mixing with coffee, and tourists dodging raindrops while trying to catch the perfect shot of the famous fish toss. These elements combine to create a rich tapestry of human experience that's perfect for street photography.

## Technical Approach

For this shoot, I used my trusty Canon AE-1 loaded with Kodak Tri-X 400. The film's high contrast and beautiful grain structure perfectly complement the moody Seattle weather. I kept my aperture around f/8 for decent depth of field and shot mostly at 1/125s to freeze motion while maintaining some environmental blur.

## Capturing Candid Moments

The key to successful street photography is becoming invisible. I spent time in each location, letting people get used to my presence before starting to shoot. This approach yielded some beautiful candid moments:

- A flower vendor arranging her bouquets in the early morning light
- Steam rising from fresh coffee cups as customers huddled under awnings
- The synchronized movement of the fish market crew preparing for their famous toss
- Children pressing their faces against bakery windows

## Lessons Learned

1. **Patience is key**: The best shots often come after waiting in one spot for the right moment
2. **Weather is your friend**: Rain creates interesting reflections and forces people to interact with their environment in unique ways
3. **Keep it simple**: Sometimes the most powerful images are the simplest ones
4. **Respect your subjects**: Always be mindful of people's privacy and personal space

## Looking Forward

This rainy day shoot has inspired me to start a series on Seattle's various neighborhoods and their unique characters. Each area of the city has its own story to tell, and I'm excited to capture these narratives through my lens.

Stay tuned for more street photography adventures, and don't let a little rain keep you from getting out there and shooting!
