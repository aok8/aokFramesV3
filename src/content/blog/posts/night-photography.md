# After Dark: Exploring Seattle's City Lights

Night photography has always fascinated me. There's something magical about how artificial light transforms familiar scenes into something entirely new. Last night, I ventured into downtown Seattle to explore the city after dark and experiment with some night photography techniques.

## Planning the Shoot

Timing is crucial for night photography. I started shooting during the blue hour (just after sunset) when there's still some ambient light in the sky. This creates a beautiful balance between natural and artificial light. I continued shooting well into the night to capture the city at its most vibrant.

## Equipment and Settings

For this shoot, I used:
- Canon AE-1 with 50mm f/1.8 lens
- Tripod (essential for long exposures)
- Cable release to minimize camera shake
- Kodak Portra 800 film (pushed to 1600)

Key settings:
- Aperture: f/8 to f/16 for maximum depth of field
- Shutter speed: 1-30 seconds depending on the scene
- Manual focus (autofocus can struggle in low light)

## Favorite Locations

### Pike Place Market Sign
The iconic neon sign was my first stop. The challenge was finding the right angle to capture both the sign and the street activity below. I ended up shooting from across the street, using passing car lights to add dynamic light trails to the composition.

### Seattle Great Wheel
The Ferris wheel's changing LED patterns created interesting opportunities for long exposures. I experimented with different shutter speeds to capture various patterns and reflections in the water.

### Downtown Intersections
The grid of city streets provided perfect leading lines, while traffic lights and car trails added dynamic elements to the compositions.

## Technical Challenges

Night photography presents unique challenges:
1. **Metering**: Film cameras can struggle with extreme contrast in night scenes
2. **Reciprocity failure**: Long exposures require additional compensation with film
3. **Mixed lighting**: Different light sources create varying color temperatures
4. **Focus**: Manual focusing in low light requires practice and patience

## Tips for Night Photography

1. **Scout locations during daylight**: This helps you plan compositions and identify potential safety concerns
2. **Bring backup batteries**: Cold weather and long exposures drain batteries quickly
3. **Use reciprocity failure charts**: Different films require different exposure compensations
4. **Watch your highlights**: It's easy to blow out bright neon signs
5. **Embrace grain**: Higher ISO films add character to night shots

## Post-Processing Considerations

While I prefer to get things right in camera, night photography often requires some darkroom work:
- Dodging to recover shadow detail
- Burning to control bright highlights
- Split-filter printing for better contrast control

## Future Projects

This shoot has inspired several ideas for future night photography projects:
- A series on Seattle's historic neon signs
- Long exposure studies of public transportation
- Architectural studies focusing on lit windows and patterns
- Light painting experiments in urban environments

Night photography opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities. The city becomes a different place after dark, and capturing that transformation on film is both challenging and rewarding. I'm looking forward to more nocturnal adventures with my camera!
